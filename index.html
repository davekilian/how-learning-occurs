        <p>Learning, rather than discovering &mdash; because someone else is teaching them!</p>
        <p>The ability to pass down knowledge is one of humanity's superpowers.
           It's the cornerstone of our technological progress: nobody needs to reinvent the wheel, because we inherited the invention of wheel from our ancestors.
           By passing down our greatest discoveries and our best tools, we give each new generation the best possible starting point to make discoveries and tools of their own.
           It's an endless cycle of technological improvement!

        <h2>But, how?</h2>
        <p>How does this uniquely human ability work? The answer to that question is of particular interest to any teacher:
        after all, our job is to facilitate learning in our students!
        To answer this question, we'll have to learn a few things about the inner workings of the human brain.</p>
        <p>The first thing to know: inside, brains are complex and messy.</p>
        <p>This shouldn't be surprising: after all, brains have been evolving for over 3 million years (TODO cite).
        Evolution is a random process, of small changes occurring at random times, for no particular reason.
        Evolution has no end goal: some of those random changes stick and some don't &ndash;
        although the useful changes do tend to stick around longer than the harmful ones.</p>
        <p>The way our brains learn has evolved alongside the brain itself.
        The end result? In learning, evolution has concocted for us a complex, messy process. One that isn't easy to understand.
        Nobody can tell you for certain how learning occurs, but we're finding out more every year.</p>
        <p>Here's what we know so far . . .</p>

        <p>If we want to learn about the inner workings of learning, it'd be helpful to start with a crisp definition.
        Given we learn new things all the time, often without even trying, learning may at first seem like a simple process.
        Mirriam-Webster defines "learning" as:</p>
        <div style="padding-left: 2em">
          <h2>learning (noun)</h2>
          <p>learn·​ing | \ ˈlər-niŋ \</p>
          <ol>
            <li>: the activity or process of gaining knowledge or skill by studying, practicing, being taught, or experiencing something : the activity of someone who learns</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        <p>This definition already gives a hint at a more complex underlying system: learning is an <i>activity</i> or a <i>process</i>.
        (Shunck, 2020) expands on this definition, giving us more of an idea of what might be going on (p. 2):</p>
        <div style="padding-left: 2em">
          <p style="font-style: italic">Learning involves acquiring and modifying knowledge, skills, strategies, beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors. People learn cognitive, behavioral, linguistic, motor, and social skills, and these can take many forms.
        </div>
        <p>Learning consists of a set of ongoing processes that go back and forth, feeding into each other.
           Here are some of them:</p>

        <p>These are just some of the ways the brain processes information as part of learning.
           There are certainly more &ndash; probably even some nobody has thought of yet!</p>
        <p>It might be tempting to think of these processes as a progression: for example, to assume that
           one first conceptualizes a new idea, then elaborates on it, contextualizes it, identifies generalizations and works toward transfer.
           Certainly there are some interdependencies between these processes, but remember, the brain is not such an orderly system!
           These processes go back and forth, feeding into one another from one idea to the next.</p>
