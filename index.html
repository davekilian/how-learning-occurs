        <p>Learning, rather than discovering &mdash; because someone else is teaching them!</p>
        <p>The ability to pass down knowledge is one of humanity's superpowers.
           It's the cornerstone of our technological progress: nobody needs to reinvent the wheel, because we inherited the invention of wheel from our ancestors.
           By passing down our greatest discoveries and our best tools, we give each new generation the best possible starting point to make discoveries and tools of their own.
           It's an endless cycle of technological improvement!

        <h2>But, how?</h2>
        <p>How does this uniquely human ability work? The answer to that question is of particular interest to any teacher:
        after all, our job is to facilitate learning in our students!
        To answer this question, we'll have to learn a few things about the inner workings of the human brain.</p>
        <p>The first thing to know: inside, brains are complex and messy.</p>
        <p>This shouldn't be surprising: after all, brains have been evolving for over half a billion years (Tae-Yoon et al., 2018).
        Evolution is a random process, of small changes occurring at random times, for no particular reason.
        Evolution has no end goal: some of those random changes stick and some don't &ndash;
        although the useful changes do tend to stick around longer than the harmful ones.</p>
        <p>The way our brains learn has evolved alongside the brain itself.
        The end result? In learning, evolution has concocted for us a complex, messy process. One that isn't easy to understand.
        Nobody can tell you for certain how learning occurs, but we're finding out more every year.</p>
        <p>Here's what we know so far . . .</p>

        <p>If we want to learn about the inner workings of learning, it'd be helpful to start with a crisp definition.
        Given we learn new things all the time, often without even trying, learning may at first seem like a simple process.
        Mirriam-Webster defines "learning" as:</p>
        <div style="padding-left: 2em">
          <h2>learning (noun)</h2>
          <p>learn·​ing | \ ˈlər-niŋ \</p>
          <ol>
            <li>: the activity or process of gaining knowledge or skill by studying, practicing, being taught, or experiencing something : the activity of someone who learns</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        <p>This definition already gives a hint at a more complex underlying system: learning is an <i>activity</i> or a <i>process</i>.
        (Shunck, 2020) expands on this definition, giving us more of an idea of what might be going on (p. 2):</p>
        <div style="padding-left: 2em">
          <p style="font-style: italic">Learning involves acquiring and modifying knowledge, skills, strategies, beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors. People learn cognitive, behavioral, linguistic, motor, and social skills, and these can take many forms.
        </div>
        <p>Learning consists of a set of ongoing processes that go back and forth, feeding into each other.
           Here are some of them:</p>

        <p>Our senses provide us with rich, detailed information about the world.
           That information ends up in working memory, where we process it.

          <div style="display:table-cell; width:65%; vertical-align: middle">
          <p>The short answer is we don't have to &ndash; at least not consciously!
             Our minds are constantly scanning our senses, automatically picking things that seem 'important' to move into working memory, and throwing everything else away.
             In everday language, we call this process "<b>noticing</b>."</p>

        <p>As a mental process, noticing derives from our genetic history.
           We tend to notice things that would help us identify opportunities and threats while fending for ourselves in the natural world.
           Things like:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Loud sounds, sudden sounds, and human voices (especially babies)</li>
          <li>Bright things, movement and human faces</li>

        </ul>
        <!-- TODO the above would be an obvious place to throw in some citations -->
        <p>These are just some of our built-in mental tools for noticing. Nobody has a complete list!</p>
        <p>Other than sensing and noticing, there's another way to get information into working memory: <b>recall</b>.
           That's a fancy way of saying "remembering stuff."</p>

        <p>We've already talked a little about working memory.
           Recall involves a second type of memory, commonly known as <b>long-term memory</b>.
           Specifically, recall means activating an idea in long-term memory, adding it to working memory.
           Once the idea has been recalled into working memory, we can process it.</p>
        <p>Like working memory, we don't completely understand long-term memory &ndash; but we are actively doing research!
           Right now, many scientists believe memories are formed via a two-step process (Rasch &amp; Born, 2013):</p>

        <!-- We need to say something about the process of recall ... right? -->
        <p>Surprisingly, our brains may encode new long-term memories from <i>anything</i> in our working memories &ndash; even ideas we just recalled!
           In fact, studies confirm repeatedly recalling an idea can distort it: when you remember the recalled idea, it gets mixed with other ideas
           that were also in working memory at the same time (Bridge &amp; Paller, 2012).</p>
        <h1>In Review</h1>
        <p>What do we know about learning so far?</p>
        <p>We know that we get information into working memory via sensing and long-term recall.
           Once we have information in working memory, we know we can process it &ndash; elaboration, contextualization, generalization and so on.
           This results in new ideas, which get encoded and consolidated as long-term memories.
           Those ideas are then available for recall when we need them again.</p>
        <p>That might seem like a pretty complete cognitive model of learning.
           But we're still missing a big piece &ndash; a uniquely human one ...</p>

        <p>We call our ability to direct our own thought processes <b>executive control</b>.
           Executive control encompasses everything listed above, and more.</p>
        <p>We know humans have executive control, as well as several things ways humans can use executive control to influence their own thought processes.
           We don't have as clear of a picture of what exactly causes a brain to activate its executive control abilities.
           One system that appears to be heavily involved is <b>motivation</b>.</p>

        <p>Motivation is a complex system of cognitive processes.
           Motivation is not the same as learning, but is often involved in learning.
           We know a lot about what drives motivation, but comparatively little about its neurological basis.</p>
        <p>At its core, motivation is a reward/punishment system, driving us to seek rewarding things and avoid punishment.
           Psychologists call this <b>conditioning</b>.
           In other words, our motivational systems drive us to repeat rewarding behaviors and avoid punishment.</p>
        <p>Just like with learning, our brains come with some automatic motivational behaviors that seem to be based
           on our genetic ancestors' need to survive in the natural world. These include:</p>

          </div>
          <div style="display:table-cell; width:65%; vertical-align: middle">
            <p><b>Survival</b>: Basic living functions such as eating, sleeping and reproduction are rewarding and thus self-reinforcing.
            Things which threaten our survival such as hunger, pain and disease are punishing &ndash; we tend to avoid them.</p>
          </div>
        </div></div>
        <div style="display:table"><div style="display:table-row">
          <div style="display:table-cell; width:65%; vertical-align: middle">
            <p><b>Social</b>: Friendship and feeling of group status (belonging) are rewarding.
            Ostracization and rejection are punishing.</p>

          </div>
          <div style="display:table-cell; width:65%; vertical-align: middle">
            <p><b>Achievement</b>: Creative expression and succeededing at meaningfully difficult tasks are both rewarding;
            failure is punishing.</p>
          </div>
        </div></div>
        <p>In additional to these self-centered factors, humans can be motivated by <b>empathy</b>:
           our mental models of other people's mental states.
           We find other people's rewarding experiences to be rewarding oursleves,
           and we find other people's punishments to be punishing ourselves &ndash;
           especially when we had a hand in creating them.</p>
        <p>Like with learning humans have some metacognitive control over motivation:</p>
        <p>We can deliberately influence how motivational signals influence us.
           We can choose to ignore punishing signals (like exercise being unpleasant today) or focus on imagined or yet-unrealized
           rewards (like being in shape).
           However, this only works to an extent: eventually, once we expend our 'will power,' we're left with limited metacognitive control over motivation.
        </p>
        <p>We also have indirect control over our motivation.
           For example, we can set goals and monitor our progress toward those goals, thereby constructing our own rewards and punishments.
        </p>
        <p>Certain key beliefs about ourselves appear to influence how motivational signals affect our behavior.
           (Dweck, 2007) described a <b>growth mindset</b> as a set of self-beliefs about one's ability to learn and develop,
           as opposed to a <b>fixed mindset</b> which stresses ones innate capacities that cannot be developed.
           In particular, Dweck found that people with growth mindsets had stronger reactions to rewards (realized and unrealized) and
           weaker reactions to punishment, helping drive a pattern of persistence that leads to success.</p>
