        <p>Learning, rather than discovering &mdash; because someone else is teaching them!</p>
        <p>The ability to pass down knowledge is one of humanity's superpowers.
           It's the cornerstone of our technological progress: nobody needs to reinvent the wheel, because we inherited the invention of wheel from our ancestors.
           By passing down our greatest discoveries and our best tools, we give each new generation the best possible starting point to make discoveries and tools of their own.
           It's an endless cycle of technological improvement!

        <p>But how does this uniquely human ability work? The answer is of particular interest to any teacher:
        after all, our job is to facilitate our students' learning!
        To answer this question, we'll have to learn a few things about the inner workings of the human brain.</p>
        <p>The first thing to know: inside, brains are complex and messy.</p>
        <p>This shouldn't be surprising: after all, brains have been evolving for over half a billion years! (Tae-Yoon et al., 2018.)
        Evolution is a random process, of small changes occurring at random times, for no particular reason.
        Evolution has no end goal: some of those random changes stick and some don't &ndash;
        although the useful changes do tend to stick around longer than the harmful ones.</p>
        <p>The way our brains learn has evolved alongside the brain itself.
        The end result? In learning, evolution has concocted for us a complex, messy process. One that isn't easy to understand.
        One preoccupied with solving problems &ndash; like surviving in nature &ndash; that we're no longer concerned with solving.
        Nobody can tell you for certain how learning occurs, but we're finding out more every year.</p>
        <p>Here's what we know so far . . .</p>

        <p>If we want to learn about the inner workings of learning, it'd be helpful to start with a crisp definition.
        Given we learn new things all the time, often without even trying, learning may at first seem like a simple process.
        Mirriam-Webster defines "learning" as:</p>
        <div style="padding-left: 2em">
          <h2>learning (noun)</h2>
          <p>learn·​ing | \ ˈlər-niŋ \</p>
          <ol>
            <li>: the activity or process of gaining knowledge or skill by studying, practicing, being taught, or experiencing something : the activity of someone who learns</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        <p>This definition already gives a hint at underlying complexity: learning is an <i>activity</i> or a <i>process</i>.
        (Shunck, 2020) expands on this definition, giving us more of an idea of what learning might involve (p. 2):</p>
        <div style="padding-left: 2em">
          <p style="font-style: italic">Learning involves acquiring and modifying knowledge, skills, strategies, beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors. People learn cognitive, behavioral, linguistic, motor, and social skills, and these can take many forms.
        </div>
        <p>Learning consists of a set of ongoing processes that go back and forth, feeding into each other.
           Here are some of them:</p>

            But we do know that we don't have much of it: studies show most people can keep about seven different ideas or pieces of information in working memory at a time (Schunk, 2020).

          <div style="display:table-cell; width:65%; vertical-align: middle; padding-left: 1em">
            <p>We also know working memory is fragile: as our working memory fills up, ideas that were already in working memory are destroyed by new incoming information.
            Scientists who study memory call this process <b>interference</b> (Rasch &amp; Born, 2013).</p>
          </div>
        </div></div>
        <p>The seven cognitive processes we discussed earlier &ndash; conceptualization, elaboration, contextualization, reinforcement, generatlization, reorganization and transfer &ndash;
           all operate on ideas stored in working memory.
           So, to complete our picture of how learning occurs in the brain, what we really need to know is:</p>
        <center><p><i>How does information get into working memory?</i></p></center>
        <p>There are two routes: sensing and recall.
           Let's start with sensing.</p>
        <div style="display:table; width:100%; height:25vh; padding-bottom:1em">
          <div style="display:table-row; width:100%; height:50%; clear:both">

          </div>
        </div>

        <p>Our senses provide us with rich, detailed information about the world.
           That information ends up in working memory, where we process it.
           But there's a problem: working memory is tiny!
           How can we cut all that rich sensory data down into just a few key pieces of information?</p>
        <a id="attention-noticing" />
        <div style="display:table"><div style="display:table-row">
          <div style="display:table-cell; width:65%; vertical-align: middle">
          <p>The short answer is we don't have to &ndash; at least not consciously!
             Our minds are constantly scanning our senses, automatically picking things that seem 'important' to move into working memory, and throwing everything else away.
             In everday language, we call this process "<b>noticing</b>."</p>
          </div>
          <div class="image" style="display:table-cell; width:35%; vertical-align: middle; padding:1em; background-image:url('./filter.svg')"></div>
        </div></div>
        <p>As a mental process, noticing derives from our genetic history.
           We tend to notice things that would help us identify opportunities and threats while fending for ourselves in the natural world.
           Things like:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Loud sounds, sudden sounds, and human voices (especially babies)</li>
          <li>Bright things, movement and human faces</li>
          <li>Patterns we've recognized before</li>
        </ul>
        <!-- TODO the above would be an obvious place to throw in some citations -->
        <p>These are just some of our built-in mental tools for noticing. Nobody has a complete list!</p>
        <p>Other than sensing and noticing, there's another way to get information into working memory: <b>recall</b>.
           That's a fancy way of saying "remembering stuff."</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="image" style="height:40vh; background-image:url('recall.svg')"></div>

    <div class="section">
      <div class="text">
        <a id="long-term-memory" />
        <p>We've already talked a little about working memory.
           Recall involves a second type of memory known as <b>long-term memory</b>.
           Specifically, recall means activating an idea in long-term memory, thereby adding it to working memory.
           Once the idea has been recalled into working memory, we can process it.</p>
        <p>Like working memory, we don't completely understand long-term memory &ndash; but we are actively doing research!
           Right now, many scientists believe memories are formed via a two-step process (Rasch &amp; Born, 2013):</p>
        <div style="display:table; margin-bottom:1em"><div style="display:table-row">
          <div class="image" style="display:table-cell; width:35%; vertical-align: middle; padding:1em; background-image:url('encode.svg')"></div>
          <div style="display:table-cell; width:65%; vertical-align: middle">
            <p><b>Encoding</b>: Thoughts in working memory are first 'encoded' into long-term memory.
               This happens while we're awake, and the resulting memories are <i>plastic</i>: easy to change, and easy to forget!</p>
          </div>
        </div></div>
        <div style="display:table"><div style="display:table-row">
          <div style="display:table-cell; width:65%; vertical-align: middle">
            <p><b>Consolidation</b>: When we sleep, newly encoded memories are consolidated, with each other and with older memories.
               This process seems to change the way we link memories together, and makes them more stable (less plastic).</p>
          </div>
          <div class="image" style="display:table-cell; width:35%; vertical-align: middle; padding:1em; background-image:url('consolidate.svg')"></div>
        </div></div>
        <!-- TODO We need to say something about the process of recall ... right? -->
        <a id="recall-distorts-memories" />
        <p>Surprisingly, our brains will go ahead and encode new long-term memories from <i>anything</i> in our working memories &ndash; even ideas that we just retrieved <i>from</i> long-term memory!
           In fact, studies confirm repeatedly recalling an idea can distort it: when you remember the recalled idea, it gets mixed with other ideas
           that were also in working memory at the same time before then being re-encoded as a new long-term memory (Bridge &amp; Paller, 2012).</p>
        <a id="memory-reinforcement" />
        <p>On the other hand, recalling a memory also seems to reinforce it, thereby making it easier to recall it again in the future.
        Paradoxically, this implies we need to recall key ideas to learn a new subject area, but at the same time, the act of recalling those ideas may itself distort them.
        No wonder so much of learning involves assessment and correction!
        </p>
        <p>TODO forgetting. Use it or lose it. Can forget at any stage, but it gets harder to forget the further the memory goes. Ramification: immediate correction</p>
        <h1>In Review</h1>
        <p>What do we know about learning so far?</p>
        <p>We know that we get information into working memory via sensing and long-term recall.
           Once we have information in working memory, we know we can process it &ndash; elaborate, contextualize, generalize and so on.
           This results in new ideas, which get encoded and consolidated into long-term memory.
           Those ideas are then available for recall when we need them again.
           Repeat the process on a large enough body of ideas, and eventually we master something bigger!</p>
        <p>That might seem like a pretty complete cognitive model of learning.
           But we're still missing a big piece &ndash; a uniquely human one ...</p>

        <p>So far, we've been talking about brain processes that occur unconsciously and automatically: sensing, memory, cognitive processing.
           In lower-order animal brains, these processes are <i>always</i> unconscious and automatic, at least as far as we can tell.
           But humans can change the equation: we can consciously direct just about every aspect of learning:</p>

               humans can also deliberately pay attention to other things.

        <p>Scientifically, we know humans have executive control, and we know several things can do using their executive control.
           However, we don't have a very clear picture of what causes a brain to activate its executive abilities.
           That said, <b>motivation</b> appears to be a large influence.
           Let's talk about that next!</p>

        <a id="motivation" />
        <p>Like learning, motivation is a complex system involving many cognitive processes working together.</p>
        <p>At its core, we believe motivation is a reward/punishment system, driving us to seek rewarding things and avoid punishment.
           Psychologists call this <b>conditioning</b>.
           In other words, our motivational systems drive us to repeat rewarding behaviors and avoid punishment.</p>
        <p>Just like with learning, our brains come with some automatic motivational behaviors that seem to be based
           on our genetic ancestors' need to survive in the natural world. These include:</p>

          <div style="display:table-cell; width:65%; vertical-align: middle">
            <p><b>Survival</b>: Basic living functions such as eating, sleeping and reproduction are rewarding and thus reinforcing.
            Things which threaten our survival, like hunger, pain and disease are punishing &ndash; we tend to avoid them.</p>

            <p><b>Achievement</b>: Creative expression and succeededing at meaningfully difficult tasks are both rewarding;
            failure is punishing.</p>
          </div>
        </div></div>
        <p>Motivators don't have to be self-centered; we can also be motivated by <b>empathy</b>:
           our mental models of other people's mental states.
           We find other people's rewarding experiences to be rewarding oursleves,
           and we find other people's punishments to be punishing ourselves &ndash;
           especially when we had a hand in causing them.</p>
        <p>Just like with learning, humans have metacognitive control over motivation:</p>
        <p>We can deliberately influence how motivational signals influence us.
           We can choose to ignore punishing signals (like exercise being unpleasant today) or focus on imagined or yet-unrealized
           rewards (like being in shape).
           However, this only works for a while: eventually, once we have expended our 'will power,' we're left with limited control over motivation.
        </p>
        <p>We also have indirect control over our motivation.
           For example, we can set goals and monitor our progress toward those goals, thereby constructing our own rewards and punishments.
        </p>
        <p>Certain key beliefs about ourselves appear to influence how motivational signals affect our behavior.
           (Dweck, 2007) described a <b>growth mindset</b> as a set of self-beliefs centered around one's ability to learn and change,
           as opposed to a <b>fixed mindset</b> which stresses innate capacities that do not change.
           Dweck found that people with growth mindsets had stronger reactions to rewards (realized and unrealized) and
           weaker reactions to punishment, helping drive a pattern of persistence that leads to success.</p>

        <h1>Essential Questions</h1>
        <p>What do you need to know about learning to be an effective teacher?</p>
        <h2>How does a learner move from an unknowing state to a knowing state?</h2>
        <p>At a basic level, the learner must first <a class="internal-link" href="#cognitive-processes">conceptualize</a> the main idea.
           Some basic facts and concepts can be directly observed through the senses.
           Other, more abstract facts can be communicated, orally or written.
           The most abstract concepts are very difficult to communicate at all &ndash; sometimes, engaging in a thought activity
           like problem solving is the most effective way to reach an idea.</p>
        <p>Most people would argue that 'knowing' involves <a class="internal-link" href="#long-term-memory">remembering</a>, at least for a while.
        Learners best remember what they know when they <a class="internal-link" href="#memory-reinforcement">repeat a thought process</a>, thereby reinforcing it.
        However, <a class="internal-link" href="#recall-distorts-memories">recall distorts memories</a>.
        Learners remember <i>correctly</i> when recall is paired with assessment and immediate corrective feedback.</p>
        <p>Many advanced concepts and skills pull are built on bodies of knowledge, rather standing alone.
        To develop these, learners <a class="internal-link" href="#subject-mastery">build a network of interrelated knowledge</a>.</p>
        <h2>Which internal factors affect learning?</h2>
        <p>Learners differ in their ability to carry out cognitive skills like logic, critical thinking, problem solving and pattern recognition.
           Although these skills can be developed, the learner's current ability determines which the learner can use to work with a new idea.</p>
        <p>A learner's existing body of knowledge, skills and experiences determines which ideas a learner is "ready" to process next.
           Vygotsky called this set of ideas the "Zone of Proximal Development," or "ZPD" (Schunk, 2020).
           New ideas outside a learner's ZPD draw on knowledge or skills the learner doesn't yet have, making it infeasible to learn those ideas right now.</p>
        <p>A learner's individual <a class="internal-link" href="#working-memory">working memory</a> capacity affects their ability to process information and come up with new ideas.
           A learner's working memory capacity is not fixed: for example, if the learner's relationship isn't going well, or is going really well,
           the relationship may reside in the learner's working memory &ndash; taking away capacity that could have been used for learning.</p>
        <p>Several factors, such as the learner's interest in the content, the learner's feelings about how related the content is to their own life,
        the learner's mindset and current energy levels <a class="internal-link" href="#motivation">affect their motivation</a> for learning.</p>
        <h2>Which external factors affect learning?</h2>
        <p>One major external factor is how well the content is delivered &ndash; that is, how easily the learner is able to conceptualize the right internal ideas for the content.
           Factors of content delivery include how the content is broken down into chunks, how clearly and concisely ideas are communicated, and the way the content is presented
           (which may be written, oral, visual and so on).
           The mode of communication is especially relevant for students with visual impairments, hearing impairments or dyslexia.</p>
        <p>The context in which content is delivered also impacts learning.
           Learning is more effective in an environment free from distractions like noise or movement, and safe enough that learners do not need to use their mental resources to
           worry about their own physical or emotional safety.</p>
        <h2>How does memory impact learning?</h2>
        <p>There are two kinds of memory: <a class="internal-link" href="#working-memory">working memory</a> and <a href="long-term-memory">long-term memory</a>.</p>
        <p>Working memory has several immediate impacts on learning and cognition.
        One ramification of working memory is its <a class="internal-link" href="#working-memory-capacity">limited capacity</a>: the human mind has many heuristics that determine what will or will not be <a class="internal-link" href="#attention-noticing">noticed</a>,
           and learning is more effective when all key ideas make it past these filters.
           In human terms, this means learning is most effective when the learners are engaged, focused, or paying attention.</p>
        <p>Working memory is also involved in <a class="internal-link" href="#cognitive-processes">key cognitive processes</a> like elaboration, contextualization, generalization and transfer.
           Learning is more effective when learners are thinking about the right things, and aren't distracted.</p>
        <p><a class="internal-link" href="#long-term-memory">Long-term memory</a> is involved in learners' ability to recall an idea or repeat a task long after it was initially learned.
        Learning is more effective when key ideas are <a class="internal-link" href="#memory-reinforcement">repeated</a>, with immediate corrective feedback, as well as when key ideas are presented in a variety of different related contexts.</p>
        <h2>What role does motivation play in learning?</h2>
        <p>Although learning is automatic in low-order animal brains, humans <a class="internal-link" href="#metacognition">play an active role</a> in learning.
           We call this ability to regulate our own learning processes <a class="internal-link" href="#metacognition">executive control</a>.
           In turn, how and when we exercise our executive control is affected by <a class="internal-link" href="#motivation">motivation</a> &ndash; an entirely separate system on mental functions.
           An unmotivated learner is thus unlikely to play an active role in his or her own learning, and thereby learn ineffectively, if at all!</p>
        <h2>How does transfer occur, and why does it matter?</h2>
        <p><a class="internal-link" href="#cognitive-processes">Transfer</a> occurs when a learner realizes that a pattern gleaned from one context applies to a new learning context.</p>
        <p>Transfer can be considered a sign of mastery: to successfully transfer knowledge to a new context, a learner would first need to have
           conceptualized the idea, elaborated on it, understood its original context, reinforced the idea until it was easy to recall, and identified
           a generalized pattern from the idea, in order to finally transfer that pattern to a new context.
           Prompting a learner to try to transfer patterns between situations is thus a way to help guide the learner through all the <a class="internal-link" href="#cognitive-processes">key learning
           processes</a> we discussed earlier.</p>
        <p>Finally, transfer is often at the heart of coming up with a clever insight, making transfer not only the pinnacle of learning,
           but one of the first key steps to advancing human knowledge.</p>
