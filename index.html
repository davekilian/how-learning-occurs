        <p>Learning, rather than discovering &mdash; because someone else is teaching them!</p>
        <p>The ability to pass down knowledge is one of humanity's superpowers.
           It's the cornerstone of our technological progress: nobody needs to reinvent the wheel, because we inherited the invention of wheel from our ancestors.
           By passing down our greatest discoveries and our best tools, we give each new generation a further starting point to make discoveries and tools of their own.
           It's an endless cycle of technological improvement!
        </p>
        <div style="margin-left: 2em; color: #888">
            <p style="font-style: italic; font-size: 125%">If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.</p>
            <p style="font-style: italic">&mdash;Sir Isaac Newton, 1675</p>
        </div>
        <p>But how does this uniquely human ability work?
        This is something every teacher wants to know: after all, our job is to facilitate learning!
        To answer this question, we'll need to know a few things about the inner workings of the human brain.</p>
        <h1>First Things First</h1>
        <p>The first thing to know: inside, brains are complex and messy!</p>
        <p>This shouldn't be surprising: after all, brains have been evolving for over half a billion years! (Tae-Yoon et al., 2018.)
        Evolution is a random process, of small changes occurring at random times, for no particular reason.
        Evolution has no end goal: some of those random changes stick and some don't &ndash;
        although the useful changes do tend to stick around longer than the harmful ones.</p>
        <p>Learning co-evolved with our brains, which means learning is just as complex and messy as the brain itself.
        Nobody can tell you for certain how learning occurs, but we're finding out more every year.</p>
        <p>Here are some things we know so far . . .</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section-card">
        <div class="section-card-text text">
        <center><h1 style="font-size: 500%; padding-bottom: 1em">What does it mean to learn?</h1></center>

    <div class="section">
      <div class="text">
        <p>Learning might seem like a simple process.
        After all, we're constantly learning new things, both big and small!
        Mirriam-Webster defines "learning" as:</p>
        <div style="padding-left: 2em">
          <h2>learning (noun)</h2>
          <p>learn·​ing | \ ˈlər-niŋ \</p>
          <ol>
            <li>: the activity or process of gaining knowledge or skill by studying, practicing, being taught, or experiencing something : the activity of someone who learns</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        <p>Already, we have a hint at underlying complexity: learning is a <i>process</i>.
        What does this process involve?
        (Shunck, 2020) gives us more of an idea (p. 2):</p>
        <div style="padding-left: 2em">
          <p style="font-style: italic">Learning involves acquiring and modifying knowledge, skills, strategies, beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors. People learn cognitive, behavioral, linguistic, motor, and social skills, and these can take many forms.
        </div>
        <p>Learning consists of a set of ongoing processes that go back and forth, feeding into each other.
           According once again to (Schunk, 2020), some of these include:</p>

        <p>Is this a complete list? Nope!
           There are certainly more &ndash; probably even some nobody has thought of yet!</p>
        <p>Some of these processes depend on each other; for example, you need to conceptualize a new idea before you can elaborate on it.
           But there processes aren't inherently ordered: they go back and forth, feeding into each other as we move from one idea to the next.</p>

            <p>These processes are fast &ndash; once set up, they often occur in less than a second (Rasch &amp; Born, 2013).
               In that sense, we learn quickly, in fits and starts.</p>
            <p>But learning something big requires a body of knowledge and skills.
               We build those iteratively, by constantly extending upon what we know.
               In that sense, learning is a gradual and ongoing process.</p>

        <!-- TODO now it's okay for the cognitive process list to disappear -->
        <p>These processes cannot play out in a vacuum.
           When we learn, our minds take an active role in processing information &ndash; but how does that information get into our minds to begin with?</p>

            But we don't seem to have much of it: studies show most people can keep about seven different ideas or pieces of information in working memory at a time (Schunk, 2020).
            Ever wonder why phone numbers are seven digits long?

            <p>We also know working memory is fragile: new ideas destroy thoughts we had in working memory as it fills up.

        <p>Any time our brains process information, it's operating on ideas in our working memory.
           So, to complete our picture of how learning occurs in the brain, what we really need to know is:</p>
        <center><p><i>How does information get into working memory?</i></p></center>
        <p>There are two routes: sensing and recall.
           Let's start with sensing.</p>

        </div>
        <p>Our senses provide us with rich, detailed information about the world.
           That information ends up in working memory, where we can process it.
           But there's a problem: working memory is tiny!
           How can we cut all that rich sensory data down into just a few key pieces of information?</p>
        <a id="attention-noticing" />
        <div style="display:table"><div style="display:table-row">
          <div style="display:table-cell; width:65%; vertical-align: middle">
          <p>Well, turns out we don't have to &ndash; at least not consciously!
             Our minds are constantly scanning our senses, automatically picking things that seem 'important' and adding them to working memory.
             Everything else gets thrown out.
             In everday language, we might call this selection process "<b>noticing</b>."
             Cognitive scientists call it <b>attention</b> (Schunk, 2020).
          </p>

        </div></div>
        <a id="distractions" />
        <p>Attention &ndash; the way we notice things &ndash; has deep roots in our genetic history.
           We tend to notice things that would help us identify opportunities and threats while fending for ourselves in the natural world.
           Things like:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Loud sounds, sudden sounds, and human voices (especially babies)</li>
          <li>Bright things, movement and human faces</li>
          <li>Patterns we've recognized before</li>
        </ul>
        <!-- TODO the above would be an obvious place to throw in some citations -->
        <p>Taking in new information via our senses is just one way to get new information into working memory.
           The other is <b>recall</b>.
           That's a fancy way of saying "remembering stuff."</p>

        <p>The brain as having two kinds of memory: working memory and <b>long-term memory</b>.
           Working memory ideas can be stored in long-term memory, allowing us to <i>recall</i> them back into working memory later (Schunk, 2020).
           In everyday language, we'd call this "remembering."</p>
        <p>We lack a complete picture of how new memories are created in long-term memory.
           We currently believe it involves this two-step process (Rasch &amp; Born, 2013):</p>

            <p><b>Encoding</b>: Thoughts in working memory are first 'encoded' into long-term memory.
               This happens while we're awake, and the resulting memories are highly <i>plastic</i>: easy to change, and easy to forget!</p>

        <p>Sleep is critical to forming new long-term memories.
           Without sleep, the consolidation process does not occur!
           In fact, there are novel PTSD treatments which <i>deliberately</i> deprive patients of sleep after a traumatic experience:
           removing details before consolidation helps them not to develop PTSD (Cohen etl al, 2012).</p>

            <p>Even fully consolidated memories aren't permanent.
               The longer we wait until the first time we recall a long-term memory after it is created, the harder it is to do so.
               We call this process <b>forgetting</b>.
               We can <b>reinforce</b> a memory by repeatedly recalling it over time, making it harder to forget.

        <a id="recall-distorts-memories" />
        <p>Paradoxically, recalling a memory can also destroy it!
           Our brains will encode anything in working memory into long-term memory &ndash; even ideas we just recalled <i>from</i> long-term memory!
           If the recalled ideas get mixed up with other things we were thinking about, the newly re-encoded memory can be distorted (Bridge &amp; Paller, 2012).
           Any activity meant to reinforce an idea should always involve immediate correction.</p>
        <p>Between memory, sensing and information processing, it might seem we're nearing a pretty complete cognitive model of learning.
           But we're still missing a big piece of the picture &ndash; a decidedly human one:</p>

        <p>So far, we've been talking about brain processes that occur unconsciously and automatically.
           In lower-order animal brains, sensing, memory and cognitive processing are <i>always</i> unconscious and automatic, as best we can tell.

           prompts the brain to activate and use its executive abilities.
           <b>Motivation</b> appears to be a large influence (Schunk, 2020).
           Let's talk about that next!</p>

        <a id="motivation" />
        <p>Like learning, motivation is a complex system of cognitive processes working together.
           At its core, we believe motivation is a reward/punishment system, driving us to seek rewarding things and avoid punishment.</p>
        <p>Motivation and learning are interdependent.
           Learning affects motivation: we learn some things feel rewarding or punishing, in a process called <b>conditioning</b> (Schunk, 2020).
           Motivation also affects learning, inspiring us to persevere through the process (Marzano, 2017).</p>
        <p>Our brains are wired to find some things rewarding and other things punishing.
           In many cases, these seem to be based on our genetic ancestors' need to survive in the natural world:</p>

            <p><b>Survival</b>: Basic living functions such as eating, sleeping and reproduction are rewarding.

            <p><b>Social</b>: We find it rewarding to make friends and feel like a valued member of a larger group.

        </div></div>
        <p>Humans have <b>empathy</b>: an ability to build mental models of other people's mental states (Schunk, 2020).
           Empathy allows us to be rewarded or punished by other people's experiences, beyond just our own.</p>
        <p>Humans have some metacognitive control over motivation.
           We can deliberately influence our motivational signals, by ignoring punishing signals (like exercise being unpleasant today) or focusing on yet-unrealized rewards (like one day being in shape).
        </p>
        <p>We also have indirect control over our motivation.
           For example, we can construct our own rewards and punishments by setting goals and monitoring our progress toward those goals (Marzano, 2017, p. 169).
        </p>
        <p>Certain key beliefs about ourselves appear to influence how motivational signals affect us.
           (Dweck, 2007) described a <b>growth mindset</b> as a set of self-beliefs centered around one's ability to learn and change,
           as opposed to a <b>fixed mindset</b> which stresses innate capacities that cannot change.
           Dweck found that people with growth mindsets persevere through setbacks, possibly due to a stronger reaction to rewards related to self growth
           and a weaker reaction to punishment due to failures of achievement.</p>
        <p>Between learning processes, sensing, memory, metacognitiion and motivation, we now have a complete framework to describe human learning
           as we know it today:</p>

    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <div class="text">
        <p>Here's the lowdown:</p>
        <p>We load information into working memory in one of two ways:
           either we notice something we sensed in our environment,
           or we recall a memory of an idea we had previously.
           Once in working memory, we can process information further, which yields new ideas and insights.
           These get encoded into long-term memory, then further consolidated while we next sleep.
           That makes these ideas available for recall the next time we need them.</p>
        <p>Even then the process of learning is not over!
           Repeatedly recalling an idea reinforces it, making it easier to recall again in the future.
           However, we must take care to make sure to correct misrecollections as soon as they happen.
           Repeat the process on a large enough body of ideas, and eventually we master something significant!</p>
        <p>We have extensive abilities of executive control, allowing us to deliberately influence every phase of this process.
           The way we use that control is influenced by motivational factors, including our mindset and our perceived progress toward our goals.
           In this way, learning feeds motivation and motivation feeds learning, in an endless loop!</p>
        <p>And that's how learning occurs!</p>
        <a id="essential-questions" />
        <h1>Essential Questions</h1>
        <p>What do you need to know about learning to be an effective teacher?</p>
        <h2>How does a learner move from an unknowing state to a knowing state?</h2>
        <p>At a basic level, the learner must first <a class="internal-link" href="#cognitive-processes">conceptualize</a> the main idea.
           Some basic facts and concepts can be directly observed through the senses.
           Other, more abstract facts can be communicated, orally or written.
           The most abstract concepts are very difficult to communicate at all &ndash; sometimes, engaging in a thought activity
           like problem solving is the most effective way to reach an idea.</p>
        <p>Most people would argue that 'knowing' involves <a class="internal-link" href="#long-term-memory">remembering</a>, at least for a while.
        Learners best remember what they know when they <a class="internal-link" href="#memory-reinforcement">repeat a thought process</a>, thereby reinforcing it.
        However, <a class="internal-link" href="#recall-distorts-memories">recall distorts memories</a>.
        Learners remember <i>correctly</i> when recall is paired with assessment and immediate corrective feedback.</p>
        <p>Many advanced concepts and skills pull are built on bodies of knowledge, rather standing alone.
        To develop these, learners <a class="internal-link" href="#subject-mastery">build a network of interrelated knowledge</a>.</p>
        <h2>Which internal factors affect learning?</h2>
        <p>Learners differ in their ability to carry out cognitive skills like logic, critical thinking, problem solving and pattern recognition.
           Although these skills can be developed, the learner's current ability determines which the learner can use to work with a new idea.</p>
        <p>A learner's existing body of knowledge, skills and experiences determines which ideas a learner is "ready" to process next.
           Vygotsky called this set of ideas the "Zone of Proximal Development," or "ZPD" (Schunk, 2020).
           New ideas outside a learner's ZPD draw on knowledge or skills the learner doesn't yet have, making it infeasible to learn those ideas right now.</p>
        <p>A learner's individual <a class="internal-link" href="#working-memory">working memory</a> capacity affects their ability to process information and come up with new ideas.
           A learner's working memory capacity is not fixed: for example, if the learner's relationship isn't going well, or is going really well,
           the relationship may reside in the learner's working memory &ndash; taking away capacity that could have been used for learning.</p>
        <p>Several factors, such as the learner's interest in the content, the learner's feelings about how related the content is to their own life,
        the learner's mindset and current energy levels <a class="internal-link" href="#motivation">affect their motivation</a> for learning.</p>
        <h2>Which external factors affect learning?</h2>
        <p>One major external factor is how well the content is delivered &ndash; that is, how easily the learner is able to conceptualize the right internal ideas for the content.
           Factors of content delivery include how the content is broken down into chunks, how clearly and concisely ideas are communicated, and the way the content is presented
           (which may be written, oral, visual and so on).
           The mode of communication is especially relevant for students with visual impairments, hearing impairments or dyslexia.</p>
        <p>The context in which content is delivered also impacts learning.
           Learning is more effective in an environment free from distractions like <a class="internal-link" href="#distractions">noise or movement</a>, and safe enough that learners do not need to use their mental resources to
           worry about their own physical or emotional safety.</p>
        <h2>How does memory impact learning?</h2>
        <p>There are two kinds of memory: <a class="internal-link" href="#working-memory">working memory</a> and <a href="long-term-memory">long-term memory</a>.</p>
        <p>Working memory has several immediate impacts on learning and cognition.
        One ramification of working memory is its <a class="internal-link" href="#working-memory-capacity">limited capacity</a>: the human mind has many heuristics that determine what will or will not be <a class="internal-link" href="#attention-noticing">noticed</a>,
           and learning is more effective when all key ideas make it past these filters.
           In human terms, this means learning is most effective when the learners are engaged, focused, or paying attention.</p>
        <p>Working memory is also involved in <a class="internal-link" href="#cognitive-processes">key cognitive processes</a> like elaboration, contextualization, generalization and transfer.
           In short, these processes operate on information currently in working memory.
           Learning is more effective when learners are thinking about the right things.</p>
        <p><a class="internal-link" href="#long-term-memory">Long-term memory</a> is involved in learners' ability to recall an idea or repeat a task long after it was initially learned.
        Learning is more effective when key ideas are <a class="internal-link" href="#memory-reinforcement">repeated</a>, with immediate corrective feedback, as well as when key ideas are presented in a variety of different related contexts.</p>
        <h2>What role does motivation play in learning?</h2>
        <p>Although learning is automatic in low-order animal brains, humans <a class="internal-link" href="#metacognition">play an active role</a> in learning.
           We call this ability to regulate our own learning processes <a class="internal-link" href="#metacognition">executive control</a>.
           In turn, how and when we exercise our executive control is affected by <a class="internal-link" href="#motivation">motivation</a> &ndash; an entirely separate system on mental functions.
           An unmotivated learner is thus unlikely to play an active role in his or her own learning, and thereby learn ineffectively, if at all!</p>
        <h2>How does transfer occur, and why does it matter?</h2>
        <p><a class="internal-link" href="#cognitive-processes">Transfer</a> occurs when a learner realizes that a pattern gleaned from one context applies to a new learning context.</p>
        <p>Transfer can be considered a sign of mastery: to successfully transfer knowledge to a new context, a learner would first need to have
           conceptualized the idea, elaborated on it, understood its original context, reinforced the idea until it was easy to recall, and identified
           a generalized pattern from the idea, in order to finally transfer that pattern to a new context.
           Prompting a learner to try to transfer patterns between situations is thus a way to help guide the learner through all the <a class="internal-link" href="#cognitive-processes">key learning
           processes</a> we discussed earlier.</p>
        <p>Finally, transfer is often at the heart of coming up with a clever insight, making transfer not only the pinnacle of learning,
           but one of the first key steps to advancing human knowledge.</p>
